**Categories**: assistant, companion

**User personas**: non-technical persons, from young adults to elderly

**Problems**:

- **Feature overload**: Existing solutions pack in too many features into their chat applications.
- **Inaccessible**: The abundance of AI models, tools, and apps is overwhelming.
- **Unnatural**: "Conversational AI" lacks the engaging, human-like interaction we expect.

**Requirements**:

- **Intuitive** interfaces that average users can use and navigate with minimal training.
- Leverage **state-of-the-art** models and techniques to deliver the best user experience.
- **Suistainable** and cost-effective.

**Proposals**:

- **Super (or universal) app**, codename: Hyperion OS
  - Specialized tools are separated into different apps.
  - Each app comes with its own widget, seamlessly integrated with the full-featured one.
- **Personable AI**: codename: Valkyrie
  - Valkyries are more than just helpful and harmless tools; they are unique, simulated beings with their own names and personalities. A whole new breed.

**OKRs**:

1. Just works
2. User's wellbeing
3. User's satisfaction

### Hyperion OS

**Metaphor**: Operating System (OS)

#### Valkyrie

**Valkyrie** is an abstration for multi-modal agents.

The first three valkyries draw inspiration from Hyperion's children in Greek mythology—Helios, Selene, and Eos—but with a Japanese flair:

- **Asu** (Amaterasu)
- **Tsuki** (Tsukiyomi)
- **Mei** (Uzume)

Additionally, Hyperion OS also comes with a system-level valkyrie named Hyperion **Ai**, who's sole mission is to guide users through all the applications.
