## 2023-??-??

**Brand**: Anti-Entropy (Æ)

**Inspiration**: [Honkai Impact 3rd](https://honkaiimpact3.fandom.com/wiki/Anti-Entropy), not related to the concept of entropy in either physics or information theory

**Target user**: me and my family (probably not for you)

**Category**: Personal AI

- It's like [Pi](https://pi.ai) or [Dot](https://new.computer/), but worse

**Differentiation**: none (okay, there are some, but it's just _implementation details_)

**Moat**: I'm building bridges, not barriers

**OKRs**:

1. Just works
2. User's wellbeing
3. User's satisfaction

**Features** (mostly TBD):

- Local-first
- Bring-your-own-key

**Default AI persona**: a conversational _partner_, not a helpful assistant

**Platform**: web and desktop

**Github**: [anti-entropy](https://github.com/thenameless7741/anti-entropy) (private)

**Domain**: [anti-entropy.app](https://anti-entropy.app)

**Design inspiration**: Honkai Impact 3rd [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3tGgYUCeU4)

**Jargons**:

- **ANTI** (Augmented Neo-Tech Intelligence): state-of-the-art AI used to develop Æ (it's embarassing to have to explain this, but whatever, it's _my_ app) — [inspiration](https://honkaiimpact3.fandom.com/wiki/MANTIS)
- **MoBiUS** (Mix of Bakas in Unified Sequences/Synchronies): my very unsophisticated implementation for chatting with many small local models at once, totally unrelated to [MoE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14705) — [inspiration](https://honkaiimpact3.fandom.com/wiki/Mobius)
