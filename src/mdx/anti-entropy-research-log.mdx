## 2024-01-27

I've been thinking about the table-stake features of a personal/conversational AI. Some, I think, are more important and universal than the others. For example, I don't need PDF summarization since I barely have any PDFs on my computer. Meanwhile, immediate feedback (e.g. from a streaming response) is crucial for almost everyone.

I'll maintain a list of them here or on [Human × AI Interaction](/stellar-sea/human-ai-interaction). Obviously, it'll be biased toward my use case/preference.

Tasks for `v0.0.1`:

As I mentioned in my [tweet](https://twitter.com/thenameless7741/status/1749924392094826964), I will focus on delivering a super basic, undifferentiated chat app (i.e. wrapper), within the next six weeks or so.

I bootstrapped a Next.js static app hosted on Cloudflare Pages.

> The struggle for life is a struggle against entropy.

**Design inspiration**: [Honkai Impact 3rd Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3tGgYUCeU4)

**Jargons**:

- **ANTI** (Augmented Neo-Tech Intelligence): state-of-the-art AI models and technologies used in Æ (really, it's just another AI wrapper) — [inspiration](https://honkaiimpact3.fandom.com/wiki/MANTIS)
- **MoBiUS** (Mix of Bakas in Unified Sequences/Synchronies): my very unsophisticated implementation for chatting with lots of small local models at once, totally not related to [MoE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14705) — [inspiration](https://honkaiimpact3.fandom.com/wiki/Mobius)
