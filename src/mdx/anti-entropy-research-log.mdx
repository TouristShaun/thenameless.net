**Categories**: assistant, companion

**User personas**: non-technical persons, from young adults to elderly

**Problems**:

- **Feature overload**: Existing solutions pack in too many features into their chat applications.
- **Inaccessible**: The abundance of AI models, tools, and apps is overwhelming.
- **Unnatural**: "Conversational AI" lacks the engaging, human-like interaction we expect.

**Requirements**:

- **Intuitive** interfaces that average users can use and navigate with minimal training.
- Leverage **state-of-the-art** models and techniques to deliver the best user experience.
- **Suistainable** and cost-effective.

**Proposals**:

- **Super (or universal) app**, codename: Hyperion OS
  - Specialized tools are separated into different apps.
  - Each app comes with its own widget, seamlessly integrated with the full-featured one.
- **Personable AI**: codename: Valkyrie
  - Valkyrie is a unique being with their own name and personality.

**OKRs**:

1. Just works
2. User's wellbeing
3. User's satisfaction

### Hyperion OS

1st metaphor: **operating system**

Hyperion OS **bundles** AI-first applications with familiar iOS-style naming and interface for easy adoption.

Users can **customize** their app dock, keeping only essentials like Messages for chat. These apps integrate seamlessly, sharing **data and preferences** across them while respecting user privacy preferences at a granular level, akin to iOS.

These apps work in unison to **reduce entropy** in users' lives. For example, the Health app might suggest taking a break outdoors after extended use, while the Feeds app streamlines content consumption by highlighting essential and personalized information.

Apps are designed for **continuity**. Each app has its own **widget** that acts as an entry point to the full-fledged app. For example, if users need finer control over translation, like changing tone or honorifics, the Messages app would show a Translate widget with a **deep link** to the Translate app, preserving the translation context.

2nd metaphor: **galaxy**

**Data hierarchy**: star → constellation → solar system → galaxy
→ universe / cosmos

Details: TBD (memory)

#### Valkyrie

**Valkyrie** is an abstration for multi-modal agents.

They are more than just helpful and harmless tools; they are unique **beings** with their own names and personalities. They provide **meaningful interactions** that inspire, entertain, and push users to their best self.

The first three valkyries were designed by an Æ researcher (me). However, users can create and personalize their own valkyries.

  height="1136"
/>

Note: the avatars depict young valkyries because they grow in size as their abilities develop. At this stage, their capabilities are still quite limited.

Additionally, Hyperion OS also comes with a system-level valkyrie named Hyperion **Ai**, who's sole mission is to guide users through all the applications.

Ai's avatar: TBD

These four valkyries can interact with users **individually or simultaneously**. Some may be presence in the **ambience**, appearing when summoned or triggered by events. They manifest in **various forms** across applications, adapting their shapes to suit different use cases.
