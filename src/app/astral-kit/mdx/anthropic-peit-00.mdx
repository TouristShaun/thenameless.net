Welcome to the Prompt Engineering Interactive Tutorial!

**Course introduction and goals**

This course is intended to provide you with a comprehensive step-by-step understanding of how to engineer optimal prompts within Claude.

After completing this course, you will be able to:

- Master the basic structure of a good prompt
- Recognize common failure modes and learn the '80/20' techniques to address them
- Understand Claude's strengths and weaknesses
- Build strong prompts from scratch for common use cases

**Course structure and content**

This course is structured to allow you many chances to practice writing and troubleshooting prompts yourself. The course is broken up into **9 chapters with accompanying exercises**, as well as an appendix of even more advanced methods. It is intended for you to **work through the course in chapter order**.

**Note:** This tutorial uses our smallest, fastest, and cheapest model, Claude 3 Haiku. We have [two other models](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/models-overview), Claude 3 Sonnet and Claude 3 Opus, which are more intelligent than Haiku, with Opus being the most intelligent.

When you are ready to begin, click on the [Basic Prompt Structure](./anthropic-peit-01) to proceed.
