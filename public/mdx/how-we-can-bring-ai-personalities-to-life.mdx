## How we can bring AI personalities to life

by Mariana Lin

Quotes from the [video](https://www.ted.com/talks/mariana_lin_how_we_can_bring_ai_personalities_to_life):

> Personality means a million ways to be creative, because there really are a million ways to respond to the same thing and to say the same thing.

> Personalities, after all, are inconvenient, inefficient, risky.

> People's personalities have always been outside our control. It creates friction in our lives. But it's what keeps life interesting and real... If we do away with the discomfort of relating with others not exactly like us, with views not exactly like ours, I think we do away with what makes us human.

> I think AI shouldn't just imitate humans, it's not enough of a goal in and of itself.

Quotes from the [linked article](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2018/05/02/how-to-write-personalities-for-the-ai-around-us/):

> If we design our AI to simply function well, our society may progress with increased speed in efficiency and convenience. But if we are also designing them to have thoughtful personalities and belief systems, our society may advance in areas where we have ostensibly made less progress—enhancing joy, delight, compassion, and deeper relationships.

> In AI, we are essentially designing a new class of beings, ones we will live with. Those AI with little or no physical form, like Siri or Alexa, reside in our inner sanctums (our homes, our cars, our devices) and impact our psychic reality. These virtual beings can make us laugh, frustrate us, or inspire us.

> Industry makers want AI to improve human life, and the public wants AI that will be useful. Without a function, AI is dead.

> We can feel pure pleasure when we encounter something random and patently unuseful about our AI, something that sparks our delight and trust. To reference that old adage about love and sex, one might say delight without function leaves a human frustrated, but function without delight leaves a human cold. And AI already feels cold enough.

> I believe we can and should design AI to nudge humans toward the highest form of connection. There are ways in which dialogue, in counseling bots for example, can be written to value the simple transcendence of connection over other tangible goals… AI can model new ways of relating to children with autism or people with disabilities. In the future, robots might be designed to teach us to relate better to each other, in ways that now seem old-fashioned.
